      <description>&lt;p&gt;While on my journey to land my first full-time job in the tech industry,
I have decided to move back in with my father, who has just retired,
to save some money in case I need to relocate. He has tons of
free time on his hands, which he spends on his hobby of taking care of fish.
He has so many fish tanks that I am now literally &lt;strong&gt;SLEEPING WITH THE FISHES.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Network management requires machines to be able to communicate efficiently, and
one of the simplest ways to achieve this is via domain names. But how does a
machine know where to send traffic for any particular domain name?
Without proper name resolution, communication becomes challengingâ€”at best
requiring humans to memorize IP addresses, and at worst causing a complete
communication failure. By the end of this article, you will know how to
configure name resolution on a Linux machine and ensure seamless
communication across your network.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
