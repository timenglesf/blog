      <description>&lt;p&gt;While on my journey to get my first full time in the tech industry I have decided
to move back in with my father who has just retired. He has tons of free time on his hands
which he uses to spend time on his hobby of taking care of fish. He has so many fish tanks
that I now literally &lt;strong&gt;SLEEPING WITH THE FISHES&lt;/strong&gt;. While it is great to be home
and see that my father is enjoying his deserved retirement, his enthusiasm for
taking care of the fish can be pretty distracting while I am trying to study for
certifications and work on projects. In order to be in a more productive environment
for my studies I have decided to join a local co-working space called Hacker Dojo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Network management requires machines to be able to communicate efficiently, and
one of the simplest ways to achieve this is via domain names. But how does a
machine know where to send traffic for any particular domain name?
Without proper name resolution, communication becomes challengingâ€”at best
requiring humans to memorize IP addresses, and at worst causing a complete
communication failure. By the end of this article, you will know how to
configure name resolution on a Linux machine and ensure seamless
communication across your network.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
